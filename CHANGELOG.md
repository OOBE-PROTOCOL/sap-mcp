- Added profile inspection and switching tools for MCP clients.
- Added transaction decode, preview, signing, and submission tools with policy checks.
- Added SNS tool coverage for `synapse-sap-sdk` 0.21.x.
- Added MCP client config injection support for Claude, Hermes, OpenClaw, and Codex.
- Added optional remote-only x402 v2/pay.sh monetization gate for hosted MCP `tools/call` requests.
- Added hosted MCP pricing registry, payment usage ledger, and monetization documentation.
- Added `sap-mcp-facilitator` for OOBE-operated x402 SVM `/supported`, `/verify`, and `/settle` facilitation.
- Added `sap-mcp-pay-sh-spec` to generate a pay.sh provider YAML for hosted SAP MCP proxy monetization.
- Added a code quality audit document with release gates, engineering rules, and residual risk tracking.

### Changed

- Runtime profile configuration now protects profile-owned RPC, mode, program, and wallet values from stale MCP client environment variables unless `SAP_MCP_ALLOW_ENV_CONFIG_OVERRIDE=true`.
- The wizard creates named profiles and dedicated keypairs under `~/.config/mcp-sap`.
- The wizard UI now uses an aqua-first visual system, clearer step descriptions, and no-color accessibility support for terminal environments.
- The wizard MCP client setup step can now print manual JSON snippets for hosted `https://mcp.sap.oobeprotocol.ai/mcp` and local active-profile setups.
- The wizard now exposes hosted `https://mcp.sap.oobeprotocol.ai/mcp` as the recommended MCP client connection path and keeps it separate from local profile injection.
- Hosted MCP onboarding now states that users connect to the hosted URL while x402/pay.sh payments and value-moving tool transactions still require a wizard-created user SAP profile and user-controlled signer.
- Remote hosted deployments now publish `/.well-known/sap-mcp-wizard.json` and `/wizard/install.sh` so agents can direct users to the wizard when local SAP MCP config is missing or inaccessible.
- Agent context prompts now instruct agents to preserve the user's request language and avoid exposing keypair material.
- Tool documentation now reflects the current runtime registry: 232 tools.
- Remote HTTP transports can now gate paid tool calls before execution and settle x402 payments after successful MCP responses.
- Monetization now requires an explicit facilitator URL and documents OOBE hosted/self-hosted facilitator deployment.
- Hybrid policy logging now uses the structured runtime logger instead of direct console output.

### Fixed

- Fixed ESM-safe Solana balance support through `sol_get_balance`.
- Fixed stale permission mappings with an alignment test against the registered MCP tool surface.
- Fixed Bento policy integration tests and fail-open/fail-closed behavior.
- Fixed package release hygiene with a real MIT license, public docs, examples, schema, and changelog.
- Fixed TypeScript ESLint setup for open-source CI readiness.
- Fixed profile reloads to use the canonical runtime config pipeline, including new monetization defaults.
- Fixed signing proxy startup so env-only deployments do not require a default `config.json`.
- Removed legacy root-level documentation that conflicted with the numbered public docs.
- Removed generated macOS metadata from the source tree.

### Security

- Local keypair signing is isolated to the SAP MCP profile wallet and does not touch the Solana CLI keypair.
- MCP client injection no longer pins wallet paths or RPC overrides by default.
- Private key and transaction policy guards run before MCP tool execution/signing paths.
- Payment audit logs store request hashes and settlement metadata, not keypair bytes, raw arguments, or x402 payment signatures.
- Paid x402 virtual resource paths are bound to the SHA-256 hash of the exact JSON-RPC request body.
